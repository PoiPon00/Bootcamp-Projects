# Data Science Bootcamp Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Bootcamp Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects completed during my journey through a comprehensive data science bootcamp organized by InfoShare Academy. Each project showcases my skills and growth in various programing and machine learning aspects! 

## Projects Overview:

### 1. [Project SQL](https://github.com/PoiPon00/bootcamp-projects/tree/main/Projekt%20SQL%20NBA): **Comparasion of physical characteristics of NBA players** 🏀
