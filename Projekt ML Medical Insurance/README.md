#  **Predicting medical inusrance Cost 🚑**

Welcome to the Medical Insurance Cost Predictor project! This project leverages machine learning to predict medical insurance costs based on various factors.
By analyzing personal data like: sex, age, bmi, number of children and smoking status the model is able to provide accurate estimates for future insurance expenses, 
helping individuals and insurance providers make informed decisions.

🌱 My contribtion consisted of carrying out EDA and writing code for a simple application in Mercury framework. 🌱

## **Project Overview:**

- 📊 **Datasets**: [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).
- 🏆 **Application Goal**: Determining health costs based on the insured person's physical characteristics. 
- 💻 **Technologies used**: Pandas, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Linear and Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, Radom Forest, Mercury.

## **How to use:**
1. To view project application I recommend first installing [Mercury](https://runmercury.com/) framework.
   
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

       git clone git@github.com:PoiPon00/bootcamp-projects.git
   
3. Navigate to path "Projekt DL Cats vs Dogs/mercury" in Anaconda Prompt from where you cloned the repository.
   
4. Start Mercury by runing this command in Anaconda Prompt.
   
       mercury run
   
5. A new window should open in your browser where you can choose to view presenation labeled "Projekt ML".
