#  **Classification of Cats vs Dogs picture dataset** 🐈vs🐕

Welcome to the Cat vs Dog Image Classifier project! This project aim was to build a deep learning model to classify whether an input image contains a cat or a dog. The model was trained using pretrained convolutional neural network - DenseNet121 to achieve accurate and reliable predictions. Additionaly out team decided to implement mulilabel classification for 5 chosen cat breeds with the help of InceptionV3 network.

🌱 My contribtion consisted of implementing and training both models and writing code for a simple application in Mercury framework. 🌱

## **Project Overview:**

- 📊 **Datasets**: [Cats vs Dogs Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset) and [Cat Breeds Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shawngano/gano-cat-breed-image-collection).
- 🏆 **Application Goal**: Imlementing systems to help search for lost pets by narrowig down search results. 
- 💻 **Technologies used**: TensorFlow, Keras, Model Fine-Tuning, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, Image Augmentation, Mercury.

## **Project Overview:**

- 📊 **Datasets**: [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).
- 🏆 **Application Goal**: Determining health costs based on the insured person's physical characteristics. 
- 💻 **Technologies used**: Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Linear and Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, Radom Forest, Mercury.

## **How to use:**
1. To view project application I recommend first installing [Mercury](https://runmercury.com/) framework.
   
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

       git clone git@github.com:PoiPon00/bootcamp-projects.git

3. Unzip files [PetsSplit.zip] and [BreedsSplit.zip] located in "Projekt DL Cats vs Dogs/mercury" folder.
   
4. Navigate to path "Projekt DL Cats vs Dogs/mercury" in Anaconda Prompt from where you cloned the repository.
   
5. Start Mercury by runing this command in Anaconda Prompt.
   
       mercury run
   
6. A new window should open in your browser where you can choose to view presenation labeled "Projekt DL".
