#  **Anticipating countires targeted by GreenPeace** 🌳

Welcome to the GreenPeace Targeted Countries Anticipation project! This Python-based EDA aims to predict countries that are likely to be targeted by Greenpeace based on international energy statistics. By analyzing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and renewable energy production in European countries, as well as the USA, China, Russia, and India, this project provides insights into regions that may benefit from Greenpeace initiatives.

🌱 My contribtion consisted of analysing the amout and type of renewable energy produced in given countires. 🌱

## **Project Overview:**

- 📊 **Datasets**: [International Energy Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unitednations/international-energy-statstics?resource=download&select=all_energy_statistics.csv) + [Energy Statistics Yearbook - 2015](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energystats/pubs/yearbook/documents/2015eyb.pdf) used to understand provided data.
- 🏆 **Main Goal**: Analysis of countries in terms of CO2 emission and energy production from renewable sources. 
- 💻 **Technologies used**: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, MatPlotLib, Seaborn.
